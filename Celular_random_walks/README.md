In this repository the code of the project called: DESIGN OF AN ANOMAL BROWNIAN ANOMAL BROWNIAN MOVEMENT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM BASED ON CONVOLUTIONARY NETWORKS FOR CHARACTERIZATION AND SEGMENTATION IN CELLULAR ENVIRONMENTS will be presented. This was designed as end-of-course work for the bachelor's degree in biomedical engineering.

In summary, the plasma membranes of the different cells that make up plant and animal organisms have a very specific characteristic, fluidity. This allows the different molecules of its surface (lipids, proteins, glycolipids, etc.) to move through it by means of different movements. These movements are called anomalous random motions (ARW) which can be characterized by different types of spatial probability distributions. The study of the type of movement that a molecule has on this cell surface can help us to determine on what type of environment it is moving, that is, on which cellular compartment it is, since the membrane can be divided into many types of surfaces.

Thus, in this project we propose the analysis of this type of movements through the use of convolutional neural networks. In this way, different trajectories will be generated using the codes of generation of random movements to be subsequently analyzed using the designed networks.
